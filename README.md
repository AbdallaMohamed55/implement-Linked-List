To study and implement Linked List

#  Aim 

To study the concept of linked lists and implement operations such as creation, insertion, deletion, and traversal using C++.

# Theory 

A Linked List is a linear data structure in which elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) contains two parts:

  1.Data – stores the actual value or information.

  2.Pointer (Next) – stores the address of the next node in the list.

The first node is known as the head, and the last node points to NULL, indicating the end of the list

  ## Types of Linked Lists:

    1. Singly Linked List: Each node points to the next node only.

    2. Doubly Linked List: Each node has two pointers — one to the next and one to the previous node.

    3. Circular Linked List: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular structure.

  ## Advantages:

   * Dynamic memory allocation (size can change at runtime)
   * insertion and deletion compared to arrays

  ## Disadvantages:

  * Extra memory for pointers

  * Sequential access (cannot access directly by index)

# Procedure

  i/ Start the C++ compiler and open a new file.

  ii/ Write the above program code.

  iii/ Compile the program to check for syntax errors.

  iv/ Run the program to view the output.

  v/ Observe the linked list before and after insertion/deletion operations.

# Conclusion 

The experiment successfully demonstrates how linked lists can be used to manage memory dynamically. Unlike arrays, linked lists allow efficient insertion and deletion of elements without shifting data. This concept is fundamental in building more advanced data structures such as stacks, queues, and graphs.
